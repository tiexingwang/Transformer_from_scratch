It is a hub of high-level thought and innovation; it is home to some of the world’s most competitive regions and industries; and, perhaps most impressive, it has built a community and market encompassing a half-billion people.	欧洲是高水平思想和创新的枢纽；是世界最有竞争力地区和产业的所在地；最重要的是，它还构建了一个由五亿人组成的社会和市场。
But the world is changing: the Asia-Pacific region is increasingly influencing global developments, economic and otherwise.	但世界正在变化：亚太地区正在日益影响全球经济和其他发展趋势。
The Trans-Pacific Partnership – by which the United States and 11 other countries would create a mega-regional free-trade zone – would most likely accelerate this shift (all the more so if China eventually joins).	跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（Trans-Pacific Partnership，TPP，由美国和其他11国建立的巨型地区自由贸易区）很有可能加速这一变革（如果中国最终也能加入就更加如此了 ） 。
Though the TPP faces no shortage of hurdles to clear before an agreement is finalized, its potential to augment Asia’s economic power cannot be underestimated.	尽管TPP距离最终完成协议还有很多障碍需要跨越，但其扩大亚洲经济实力的潜力绝不容���觑。
Europe must work to secure its position in the new world order – beginning by enhancing its own trade and investment ties with the US.	欧洲必须致力于确保其在新世界秩序中的地位 — — 首先要强化其自身与美国的贸易和投资联系。
The problem is that, as the TPP negotiations progress, talks on the EU-US Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) have become so deeply mired in domestic controversies that the entire project may well be scuttled.	在TPP谈判不断推进的同时，欧盟-美国跨大西洋贸易和投资伙伴关系（Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership，TTIP）谈判却深陷国内矛盾的掣肘，整个工程都有可能夭折。
Business leaders on both sides of the Atlantic are convinced that a successful TTIP agreement would bring substantial economic benefits – a perception that many studies reinforce.	大西洋两岸的商业领袖相信，成功的TTIP协议将带来巨大的经济收益 — — 许多研究都强化了这一感觉。
Yet trivial issues – for example, the use of chlorinated chicken and settlements of investor disputes – continue to dominate the debate.	但一些微妙的问题 — — 比如“氯化鸡 ” （ 欧洲怀疑美国鸡肉进入市场前都用氯消毒）和投资者纠纷和解等问题 — — 仍主导着争论。
The TTIP’s goal is to unleash the power of the transatlantic economy, which remains by far the world’s largest and wealthiest market, accounting for three-quarters of global financial activity and more than half of world trade.	TTIP的目标是释放跨大西洋经济的力量 — — 目前大西洋两岸仍是世界最大最富有的市场，占全球金融活动的四分之三和世界贸易量的一大半。
(If the TTIP was opened to other economies – such as Turkey, Mexico, and Canada – the benefits would be even greater.)	（如果TTIP向其他经济体开放 — — 比如土耳其、墨西哥和加拿大 — — 则收益还将更大。 ）
Even more compelling than the benefits of achieving an agreement, though, are the potentially catastrophic consequences of failure.	但是，比达成协议的好处更加让人感到必须成功的是谈判失败可能带来的灾难性结果。
For starters, a breakdown of TTIP talks would give considerable ammunition to those in the United Kingdom who advocate withdrawal from the EU; conversely, if the TTIP were implemented, the UK would be unwise – and thus unlikely – to leave.	首先，TTIP谈判的破裂将极大地加强英国鼓吹离开欧盟阵营的力量；反之，如果TTIP获得实施，英国离开欧盟将是不明智之举，因此也不会发生。
Moreover, the perception that the EU’s internal squabbles had led it to squander a strategic opportunity would probably drive the US to accelerate its disengagement from the continent.	此外，欧洲的内讧导致其白白浪费了一个战略机会，这一感觉可能促使美国加速远离欧洲。
And Russian President Vladimir Putin would invariably regard the EU’s failure as a major opportunity to exert more influence over parts of Europe.	而俄罗斯总统普京也必然会将欧洲的失败视为影响欧洲更多地区的良机。
All of this contributes to a starkly fundamental strategic risk: If the TTIP stalls or collapses, while the TPP moves forward and succeeds, the global balance will tip strongly in Asia’s favor – and Europe will have few options, if any, for regaining its economic and geopolitical influence.	所有这些凸显出一个根本新战略风险：如果TTIP无法取得进展或失败，而TPP取得进展并成功，则全球平衡将朝着极有利于亚洲的方向发展 — — 欧洲极有可能无法重振其经济和地缘政治影响力。
When the TTIP was first proposed, Europe seemed to recognize its value.	TTIP首次提出时，欧洲似乎能够认识到其价值。
Indeed, it was the EU that pushed the US, which initially doubted Europe’s commitment, to launch the negotiation process in June 2013.	事实上，是欧洲推动一开始对欧洲的承诺有所怀疑的美国在2013年6月启动了谈判程序。
The ambition was to complete the negotiations on “one tank of gas.”	当时人们雄心万丈，意图“一鼓作气”完成谈判。
No one wanted to endure protracted talks – or the associated political pain.	没人想让谈判长久拖延 — — 或忍受因此带来的政治痛苦。
But EU leaders essentially abandoned the project, seemingly confirming American fears.	但欧盟领导人在事实上抛弃了这一工程，而这也印证了美国的担心。
